## Project Overview

This grant will be used to integrate with EOS EVM, audit the protocol, launch the platform and further develop platform features. 

### Overview

- **Name:** Fundle - Community Building
- **Brief Description:** Fundle is the all-in-one community-building platform to increase customer engagement, brand loyalty and benefits through a unique token-based membership model and new customer experiences! With Fundle, businesses can build a digital economy around their brand to get the most out of their community and further strengthen their brand-customer relationship. 

With Fundle we introduce a new generation of community building with more opportunities for engagement, revenue generation and benefits. Each business has its own token. Fans and customers can buy their desired amount of tokens to unlock the benefits and interactions they would like to have with the brand, based on the number of tokens they hold (discounts, products, interaction, access to events/experiences, etc.).  The model allows the community to be rewarded for the value they are helping create in the business. In addition, the platform offers new marketing/sales opportunities and customer insights.v

- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** With this grants we will deploy our protocol smart contracts and run our platform on the EOS EVM! 
- **Reason for Interest:** Web 3 allows us to revolutionize and strengthen the position of the community. EOS EVM allows us to “simply” integrate with the EOS ecosystem and allows our users to use the tools they are familiar with, such as MetaMask. We truly believe in the added value of EOS as blockchain, we would like to utilize the benefits of high throughput and low transaction costs for our users. These aspects are crucial for the success of our platform. With the entrance of the ENF, we see that many good developments are going on, and therefore we have trust in EOS for the future!

### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mock-ups/designs of any UI components
- Data models of the core functionality
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit
- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

  
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our target businesses are those who are interested in the potential of online community building and are focused on innovating their businesses to improve customer experiences. These businesses should preferably already be actively online and have existing communities where they would like to expand and interact with more. We are targeting web 3 interested brands, influencers with brands, and crowdfunding projects that want to offer new customer experiences or build, grow and manage their communities.

These can be businesses with existing communities who like to have more interaction with their fanbase to gain more (value) from their community and offer new customer experiences. Or startups who want to build, grow and manage their community/business.

Members buy tokens to become part of the digital community and enjoy the benefits. We are also targeting members who have never used web 3 tools before.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status

> If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/tree/main/docs/rfps) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the EOS Network Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
