### Overview

- **Name:** Fundle - Community Building
- **Brief Description:**
  Fundle is the all-in-one community-building platform to increase customer engagement, brand loyalty and benefits through a unique token-based membership model and new customer experiences! With Fundle, businesses can build a digital economy around their brand to get the most out of their community and further strengthen their brand-customer relationship.
  
  With Fundle we introduce a new generation of community building with more opportunities for engagement, revenue generation and benefits. Each business has its own token. Fans and customers can buy their desired amount of tokens to unlock the benefits and interactions they would like to have with the brand, based on the number of tokens they hold (discounts, products, interaction, access to events/experiences, etc.). Members will have social & economic incentives to help the business succeed and the community will grow not only by its members but also in economic value. The tokens stimulate active participation and promotion of the business.
  
  Our mission is to increase customer engagement, benefits and deliver more value from the community for both business and members. Community tokens allow businesses to engage with their fans more closely than ever before and allows the community to be rewarded for the value they are helping create in the business. In addition, the platform can enable new revenue streams, customer insights and the tokens can be used as an effective marketing tool for businesses.
  
  Communities will play a vital role in improving user experience and brand to customer relationships. The future will be digital, social and community-driven and web3 will change how the world will interact with each other. We believe that the current concept of monthly membership fees can be upset by the community token model.
  
  Fundle and EOS EVM potential partnership presents an exciting opportunity to introduce new users to the world of web3 and EOS. Our platform will generate transactions, boost liquidity and volume in the EOS ecosystem and showcase what is possible to build on EOS.

- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** With this grant we will deploy our protocol smart contracts and run our platform on the EOS EVM!

- **Reason for Interest:** Web 3 allows us to revolutionize and strengthen the position of the community. EOS EVM allows us to “simply” integrate with the EOS ecosystem and allows our users to use the tools they are familiar with, such as MetaMask. We truly believe in the added value of EOS as blockchain, we would like to utilize the benefits of high throughput and low transaction costs for our users. These aspects are crucial for the success of our platform. With the entrance of the ENF, we see that many good developments are going on, and therefore we have trust in EOS for the future!

### Project Details

  Our team has an ambitious long-term commitment to make Fundle the most popular all-in-one platform for community building and managing. 
  
  We see an interesting opportunity in community-building market. In these markets involvement and interaction are essential for success. With the entrance of web3, we can strengthen and improve these factors. 
  
  For businesses, the top benefits of an online community are customer loyalty, reduction in support costs and brand awareness. 70% of communities positively affect the brand and company culture. Companies with online communities are 60% more profitable than companies which do not focus on online communities.
  
  An average member contributes $67 of worth yearly to the community. 33% of organizations with an online community have 10,000 or more members. In the coming years, the social business market will potentially grow with a CAGR of 30.8% to 7 trillion by 2030. Community building is becoming an increasingly important topic for businesses. 
  
  Active participation, involvement, and engagement remains difficult for large businesses. 55% of community professionals find it difficult to consistently engage members when running online communities.  For small businesses building and managing communities remains challenging and a barrier. 44% of community professionals said it was hard to put a quantity to the community value of the community and 59% points to community scaling as one of their main goals.

  These market trends and opportunities form the basis of the Fundle platform. We can revolutionize this landscape by utilizing blockchain technology. The way of community building needs to be redeveloped to let it reach its maximum potential. We believe that building long-term relationships, involvement and control is essential for this. Our community token model allows businesses to reward members and engage with them more closely than before. 

#### How it works

  Fundle also provides an integrated chat to stimulate intensive communication and interaction, which makes it the all-in-one tool. Community can chat directly within the platform, enhances community building experience and eliminates the need for external chat channels. Business has access to opinions of community members to create user-centric products that align with needs and preferences, boosting member engagement, loyalty, and revenue.

#### Token-based Membership Protocol

We have developed a token-based membership protocol based on a token bonding curve mechanism. The protocol facilitates buy and sell and provides a stable and dynamic way to determine value. Each community has its own curve and utility token. Tokens can be bought by providing collateral for the curve in USDC. At purchase a new community token is mint/created based on the current supply of the token. When a token is sold, it is burned and so does the supply decreases.

Our innovative token bonding curve protocol have a more stable price mechanism compared to cryptocurrencies to foster reduced volatility, usability, and adoption. The price of a community token is tied to amount of economic value created in ecosystem, the price increases when the ecosystem grows (supply). This mechanism mitigates the influence of price manipulation by offering predictability, and discourages artificial inflation for profit.

In this way there is a stable mechanism regarding price where both the community and business can be rewarded for the value they help creating. Engagement and benefits determine the added value and thus, utility of the token. This utility (added value) of the token drives popularity which influences the purchase behavior and holding patterns of token holders.
 

### Ecosystem Fit
- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

  Fundle's potential partnership with the EOS blockchain presents an exciting opportunity to introduce a whole new cohort of users to the world of crypto and EOS. By leveraging the power of EOS, Fundle can showcase what is possible to build on this innovative blockchain by demonstrating the practical value of this blockchain in the real world. With a focus on fostering interaction between members and businesses, Fundle is set to generate a significant volume of transactions on the EOS Blockchain, which will, increase liquidity and volume in the EOS ecosystem. Moreover, Fundle's collaboration with EOS will enable many new and non-crypto users to explore and interact with the EOS ecosystem, expanding EOS customer base. With our application ready for launch, Fundle is set to make a significant impact on the EOS ecosystem and beyond.
  
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

  Our target businesses are those who are interested in the potential of online community building and are focused on innovating their businesses to improve customer experiences. These businesses should preferably already be actively online and have existing communities where they would like to expand and interact with more. We are targeting web 3 interested brands, influencers with brands, and crowdfunding projects that want to offer new customer experiences or build, grow and manage their communities.

  These can be businesses with existing communities who like to have more interaction with their fanbase to gain more (value) from their community and offer new customer experiences. Or startups who want to build, grow and manage their community/business.

  Members buy tokens to become part of the digital community and enjoy the benefits. We are also targeting members who have never used blockchain before.  The system is easy understandable (already tested) and customer friendly. This makes our platform useful and interesting for a wide range of people.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

   Current platforms lack community involvement and interaction. Members cannot really be "part of" and there is little interaction. 
  <img width="1387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/WiebeHendriks/grant-framework-ENF/assets/54183058/fa970c47-ab2d-4316-aa07-6c6328d69226">

  From business perspective, much more can be gained from a community (skills, opinions, etc.). An involved and active community will result in loyal customers, a reduction in support costs and an increase in brand awareness and trust. This will positively affect the profit and success of the business.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?

  To the best of our knowledge there are no similar projects in EOS or related ecosystems. Compared to other community building platforms we are unique with our token protocol. With Fundle we introduce a new generation of community building with more opportunities for engagement, revenue generation and benefits. Our token model, digital economies and ways of interaction between business and members sets us apart. 

  The Fundle protocol generates collective value, next to the business, members can now also benefit financially from community growth. Customers will have a personalized unique membership experience. The token protocol provides a unique stable and dynamic way to determine community value. At last, there is a completely different dynamic on our platform with a social media design instead of a whitelabel solution, such as some other community building platforms have.
